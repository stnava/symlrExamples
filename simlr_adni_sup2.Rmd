# Overview

The Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) distributes multi-omic
data in healthy elderly, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
subjects ages 55 to 90.  As of summer 2020, we obtained aggregate data that
span ADNI-1, ADNI-2, ADNI-GO and ADNI-3 and that summarizes a variety of measurements in 2,269 subjects.
Data is available at [http://adni.loni.usc.edu](http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

A polygenic hazard score (PHS) and related measurements were added to ADNI as the result
of recent work by the Desikan lab [1,2,3].  These measurements are also available
at the above link.  The PHS is derived from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls
from the International Genomics of Alzheimerâ€™s Project and is based on a
Cox proportional hazards model that predicts risk for AD conversion.
We merged both the PHS and the cumulative incidence rate (CIR)
into the omnibus data file to enable a multi-omics study.

The PHS models the cumulative
genetic risk for AD which includes but also goes beyond the
apolipoprotein E type 4 (APOE4) allele.
Evaluation of the PHS with respect to in vivo markers of
AD-related pathology affirmed that "amyloid and total tau positivity
systematically varies as a function of PHS" [2].  Furthermore, [3] showed
additional relationships with both longitudinal atrophy and cognitive decline.
The success of the PHS in predicting age of onset for sporadic AD
demonstrates that it may indeed capture distributed genetic risk.  However,
PHS may also capture disease processes beyond pure AD as it also correlates with
cerebrovascular pathology and presence of Lewy body pathology [3].

# Study design

In this evaluation, we will use dimensionality reduction methods to build
low-dimensional models predicting PHS from disparate modalities.  We use
dimensionality reduction as a supervised learning method for
integrating several objective measurements to predict
a lower-dimensional variable, the PHS for each individual in a test set.

## Data description

These multi-view matrices include:

* volumetric (structural) MRI measures of the hippocampus,
ventricles, whole brain, entorhinal cortex, fusiform cortex
and middle temporal cortex ($p$=6);

* AD-relevant cognitive metrics totaling $p=17$ predictors (shown in Table 1);

```

* molecular measurements of glucose metabolism (via fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)), amyloid levels
(via cerebrospinal fluid assays and AV45 PET (florbetapir)), tau and phosphorylated tau
levels from cerebrospinal fluid ($p$=5);

* genetic risk for AD (the supervising matrix) composed of the APOE4 allele (a trinary
  value in 0,1,2), the PHS and the CIR.

Subjects in this study were required to have all of the above modalities. This resulted in 723 (n=335 female) unique individuals with baseline diagnosis of either control (n=137), subjective memory complaint (n=80), MCI (n=391) or AD (n=115) with age 72.55 $\pm$ 7.2.  The mean MMSE at baseline in each diagnostic group is shown in table 1.  Specific RIDs for the included subjects appear toward the end of this report.



This complete dataset, relative to our other evaluation studies, is
more classical in the sense that $n >> p$.  As such, sparseness is perhaps
less critical to preventing overfitting and for interpretation.  We therefore
compare SiMLR *without sparseness* to RGCCA as well as SGCCA and SiMLR
variants *with sparseness*.

## Evaluation of PHS prediction

Dimensionality reduction across the joint space of brain structure,
cognition and molecular signatures of disease (amyloid and tau -
the known primary pathological vectors as well as a measure of
glucose metabolism, FDG PET) should lead to an approximation
of the latent AD space, especially with the direct supervision of PHS, CIR
and APOE4 genotype.
The polygenic risk for AD will serve as a proxy
for the true latent space, which cannot be known.  As such, we do not expect
to predict the PHS exactly but to find a latent space that is at least
related to the PHS:

> we assess the success of this learning process
via cross-validation i.e. 150 training-testing splits of the data (80\%
of data in training set) with
learning and evaluation results being tabulated at each split.  This permits a
paired $t$-test on the $R^2$ of the predicted PHS to the real PHS to compare
the methods.

\noindent This study design effectively inverts the PHS evaluation approach used in [2,3].
We achieve this by jointly decomposing the matrices describing these 4 types of
input data ( genetic risk, structure, molecular and cognition ) and then,
in a test set, demonstrate that  polygenic risk score can be predicted from the
latent space of the other 3 modalities.
RGCCA, SGCCA and SiMLR perform very closely in this study with SiMLR
showing an edge in performance across all settings.  Parameters for the methods were matched
as closely as is possible for each comparison.  Results are in Figure 1 where
we note that each run is computed with a different starting seed for the
series of cross-validation splits.  Additional details follow.

### Dimensionality reduction parameters

For both SGCCA and SiMLR, we derive two
components from the dimensionality reduction, i.e. a rank-2 solution for
each modality. We choose a very low-dimensional space for interpretability and because
the input matrices are themselves fairly small with the smallest matrix
containing only 3 columns (genetic risk). We use default parameters for each method
with a sparseness penalty, for SGCCA and SiMLR comparisons, that seeks
to zero out roughly half of the feature variables in each matrix.  For SiMLR
and RGCCA comparisons, we do not use sparseness penalties.


### Joint prediction of PHS from structure, cognition and molecular predictors

The variable selection listed in the previous section results in low-dimensional
predictors that we use in linear regression to predict PHS as an outcome variable.
Our baseline model is of the form:
$$
\text{PHS} \approx \text{Age} + \text{Gender} + \text{EducationalLevel}
$$
with each dimensionality reduction evaluated with an extended model adding
a rank-2 matrix of predictors for each modality:
$$
\text{PHS} \approx \cdots + \text{structure} + \text{cognition} + \text{molecular}
$$
where each predictor above is defined by:
$$
\text{predictor} = X_\text{predictor} * V_\text{predictor},
$$
i.e. the low-dimensional representation of each data matrix.
A better latent representation should result in a better prediction of PHS in
the test data.

## Data usage

Data used in the preparation of this report were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).
